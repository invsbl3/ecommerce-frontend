## Front End
Project with React JS for front-end.

Just a simple base, but not enough to make a real good project.


I'm following [this tutorial]{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y99YgaQjgx4} (give credits to this guy).

My focus is to learn how to build a basic E-Commerce structure and then modify the Design to a PetShop (just to train my abilities).

# RUN THE PROJECT!
- It's React Front-End was deployed with `github-pages`, so go to [https://invsbl3.github.io/ecommerce-frontend/](https://invsbl3.github.io/ecommerce-frontend/).
- It should connect properly with the Express/Node Back-End deployed with `vercel` here [https://vercel.com/invsbl3s-projects/ecommerce-api](https://vercel.com/invsbl3s-projects/ecommerce-api).


## Front End
Project with React JS for front-end.

There are several flaws of implementation, algorithms, structure both in front-end, design and back-end in this project, that comes from the tutorial itself.
I already did another back-end models with better, faster and more secure and clean code with express/node to my future projects, and I'm going to use React from scratch to build a better model of e-commerce website which really should worth for more professional intents.

This project is just a really simple base, not enough to make a real good project.


I' followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y99YgaQjgx4) (give credits to this guy).

My focus is to learn how to build a basic E-Commerce structure and then modify the Design to a Shoe Shop (just to train my abilities).
